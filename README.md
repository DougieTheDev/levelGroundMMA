## Tech Used
HTML5<br>
Structured the content of the site, including sections for the gymâ€™s introduction, services, schedule, and contact information<br>
CSS3<br>
Styled the website to be clean and professional, with a responsive layout to ensure compatibility across devices. The design was kept simple to allow easy navigation and readability.<br>

## Lesson learned
I gained more insight into web accessibility by making sure text contrast, button sizes, and other design elements were easy to read and interact with on different devices.
